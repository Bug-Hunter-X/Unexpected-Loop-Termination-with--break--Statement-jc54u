# Unexpected Loop Termination with `break` Statement
This code demonstrates an uncommon JavaScript bug related to the `break` statement within a loop. The `break` statement immediately terminates the loop when encountered, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if not used carefully.

## Bug Description
The provided JavaScript code includes a `while` loop with a conditional `break` statement.  The intention might be to perform some action after a certain condition is met and then continue the loop. However, the `break` immediately exits the loop, preventing further iterations or the execution of code after it.

## Solution
The solution lies in restructuring the code to avoid using `break` if the intention is to continue the loop's execution after the condition is met.  Alternative approaches such as using `continue`, or refactoring the loop entirely, can be explored.
